# 1 Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Background

At present, teaching materials are entirely generated by course coordinators and other teaching staff, and distributed to students. 

We want to create a tool that allows students to learn in a way that works for them, and provides more content to them when their understanding is weak. 

## 1.2 Project Objectives
The overall objectives of the project include:
1. Supporting students in understanding content more deeply through small assessment.
2. Allowing teachers to track their students' progress dynamically.
3. Enabling teachers to provide varied teaching experiences for teachers.

## 1.3 Project Restrictions
In completing the project, we have several restrictions.
1. The project must be completed in 4 weeks - from the 18/6 to 18/7.
2. The project must be completed with a team of 7 students.

## 1.4 Project Risk
