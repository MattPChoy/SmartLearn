What is Business?
What does the word "profit" mean?
- Consumers vote for your product via their cash.

## Competitive Analysis
Profit = (value - cost) x units sold
- Cost leader: low cost, high volume
- Differentiators: high value, low volume
- Focus: highest value, lowest volume

- Strategic target: entire industry or a focus segment
- Two ways to focus
  - Go after only a part of the industry market
  - Operate only 

----

- Opportunity exists wherever we see a competitive strategy that is not being pursued.
- For example, we only saw cost leaders and differentiators in the grocery business until recently. 
  - Now firms like Whole Foods and Fresh Market are employing a differentiation focus
- The greatest threat is by ending up "stuck in the middle" by not having a defined competitive strategy.

## Creating value thrugh human capi...
- Differentiation and Cost is supported through competitive analysis as it has the highest ROI.
- In the 1930-1960's airlines were industry-wide customer, focusing on the uniqueness perceived by the customer
  - Then a few other airlines joined which meant big competition.
- Then Hawaiian airlines appeared - one of the few airlines flying in hawaii
  - Very expensive, small customer segment.
- 1990's saw introduction of cost-leadership airlines
